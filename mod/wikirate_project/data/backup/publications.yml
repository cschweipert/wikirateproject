      Contribution to the SDGs — A Student Assessment</em></strong> is a partnership
      of the Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME) initiative, the
      WikiRate Project e.V. (WikiRate), the UN Global Compact, and the Bertelsmann
      Stiftung. The aims of the pilot stage of the project were to:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:

      Goals (SDGs) in the minds of the next generation of business leaders through
      active research and analysis, promoting engagement and familiarity with companies’
      reporting outputs<br>2. Seek structured ways of tracking company performance
      towards the SDGs and the UN Global Compact’s Ten Principles, testing a broad
      selection of metrics of performance from standards like the Global Reporting
      Initiative and UN Global Compact’s Poverty Footprint.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:
      justify;\">The pilot included 9 higher education institutions, with 13 professors
      in 7 countries across 5 continents, engaging 950 students and generating over
      20,000 data points on corporate sustainability performance. Student participants
      with different levels of education, from first year undergraduates through master’s
      students, generated data through researching corporate sustainability and annual
      reports of Global Compact participants submitted as Communication on Progress
      reports (COPs), and added it to the WikiRate platform.</p>\r\n</div>"

  :fields:
    :description: "<p>This paper considers an alternative way of gathering and evaluating
      information on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and the actions taken towards
      sustainable development. Social accounting theory is currently limited in conceptualising
      external accounts that sit outside the description of silent or shadow accounts.
      With the emergence of technological platforms that enable CSR information to
      be collectively located, new models of stakeholder engagement are growing using
      the wisdom of the crowd for information collation and analyses. This paper outlines
      a crowdsourced platform, WikiRate, which aims to both empower corporate transparency
      surrounding the Sustainable Development Goals and assist in multidimensional
      stakeholder participation and decision making. Existing theoretical characterisations
      of external accounts are used as a way of understanding the WikiRate engagement
      model and more broadly its relationship with social accounting. Through analysis
      and theoretical development, this research has implications for imagining and
      exploring new social accountings and social accountants that can lead to emancipatory
      change. ‘Spotlight accounting’ is introduced as a process that illuminates global
      organisational transparency and sustainability through crowdsourcing by independent

    :description: "<p>The travel and tourism industry continues to see uninterrupted
      growth, with more people than ever before travelling for work or leisure to
      a broader range of destinations. Yet this growth brings with it a greater risk
      of modern slavery.</p>\r\n<p>There is a high-risk of exploitation within the
      hotel sector due to its vulnerable workforce, complex supply chains with little
      transparency, and limited oversight from brands and multinational hotel companies
      as a result of extensive franchising. In the franchising model, hotel brands
      lend their name and customer care standards to third parties, but usually stipulate
      far less about the standards they expect for the employment of workers, even
      in countries where abuse is endemic.</p>\r\n<p>To assess how the hotel sector
      is responding to these risks, this report reviews the statements produced by
      71 hotel companies under the UK Modern Slavery Act, which requires companies
      with a turnover of £36 million to release annual statements on their anti-slavery
      efforts. We looked at whether the statements meet the Act’s minimum requirements,
      but also if they go “beyond compliance” with effective responses to modern slavery
      risks — including sexual exploitation, forced labour, and the poor treatment
      of migrant workers.</p>\r\n<p>The assessment of statements featured in this

    :description: "<p>From seafood from Thailand and electronics from Malaysia and
      China, to textiles from India and wood from Brazil, modern slavery exists in
      all corners of the planet. It is a multibillion-dollar transnational criminal
      business that affects us all through trade and consumer choices. In 2016, an
      estimated 25 million people were forced to work through threats, violence, coercion,
      deception, or debt bondage. Of these, 16 million were forced to work in the
      private sector. Given the widespread nature of the problem, governments, corporations,
      and the general public are increasingly expecting companies to accurately disclose
      the actions they are taking to tackle modern slavery. Yet, five years on, there
      are challenges with understanding companies’ compliance under the 2015 UK Modern
      Slavery Act. It is unclear which companies are failing to report under the MSA,
      while the quality of these statements often remains poor. Project AIMS (Artificial
      Intelligence against Modern Slavery) harnesses the power of artificial intelligence
      (AI) for tackling modern slavery by analyzing modern slavery statements to assess
      compliance with the UK and Australian Modern Slavery Acts, in order to prompt
      business action and policy responses. This paper examines the challenges and
      opportunities for better machine readability of modern slavery statements identified
      in the initial stages of this project. Machine readability is important to extract
      data from modern slavery statements to enable analysis using AI techniques.
      Although extensive technological solutions can be used to extract data from
      PDFs and HTMLs, establishing transparency and accessibility requirements would
      reduce the resources required to assess modern slavery reporting and ultimately
      understand what companies are doing to address modern slavery in their direct
      operations and supply chains - unlocking this critical ‘AI for Social Good’
      use case.</p>"

      style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Since the end of the 20th century, the role of
      private multinational enterprises (MNEs) has been recognized as critical in
      implementing increased sustainable production and consumption patterns. Particularly
      after the creation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Agenda
      2030, this role has increased. In this sense, this paper aims to analyze the
      measures and actions taken by companies in their contribution to the achievement
      of the SDG 12. Through the identification of more than 52 metrics in sustainability
      reports of 854 firms, findings suggest that direct greenhouse gas emissions
      and indirect greenhouse gas emissions are the most often reported corporate
      metrics to measure their impact on specific SDGs. This reveals the importance
      of sustainability actions in emerging market firms as a mechanism to gain legitimacy
      when operating in foreign markets and as an opportunity to create more sustainable
      production models.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Orinally published in </strong>[[https://publicaciones.eafit.edu.co/index.php/administer/issue/view/603|AD-Minister]]

      Guidance for Responsible </span></span><span><span>Supply Chains of Minerals
      from Conflict-Affected </span></span><span><span>and High-Risk Areas (“Minerals
      Guidance”) by a </span></span><span><span>global sample of companies producing,
      trading </span></span><span><span>and sourcing minerals or metals based on their
      </span></span><span><span>public disclosures. The study provides evidence </span></span><span><span>of
      the Minerals Guidance’s role as the keystone in </span></span><span><span>an
      emerging global architecture for responsible </span></span><span><span>business
      conduct in mineral supply chains, with a </span></span><span><span>significant
      expansion in its uptake between 2014 </span></span><span><span>and 2018.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span></span><span><span>The
      study also reveals major shortcomings </span></span><span><span>in disclosure
      related to implementation, </span></span><span><span>especially on how companies
      use due diligence </span></span><span><span>practically to identify and mitigate
      risks. In part, </span></span><span><span>this suggests growing pains as companies
      </span></span><span><span>move beyond compliance-based ap</span></span><span><span>proaches
      </span></span><span><span>typically focussed on risks to the company, to </span></span><span><span>a
