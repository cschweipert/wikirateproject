    :description: "<h1>Our Role</h1>\r\n<p>We facilitate research projects that aim
      to understand how corporations meet the challenges and requirements posed by
      existing legal frameworks. Within this program the WikiRate team assists partner
      organizations with:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Developing and testing research metrics
      to systematically extract specific information from the corporate statements.</li>\r\n<li>Refining
      methodologies to ensure the data collected is consistent and reliable.</li>\r\n<li>Recruiting
      volunteer researchers through our network of academic institutions and volunteer
      communities.</li>\r\n<li>Assisting researchers throughout the research process,
      and providing support materials such as video tutorials and step-by-step guides.</li>\r\n<li>Providing
      tech support to deal with any complications.</li>\r\n<li>Reviewing the data
      to test and improve data quality.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Once the data is gathered,
      our team reviews the data and executes random spots checks to test and improve
      data quality. The dataset can then be exported to conduct analyses.</p>\r\n<h1>Program
      Scope</h1>\r\n<p>Currently we support research on two pieces of legislation:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The
      UK Modern Slavery Act which as of 2015 mandates commercial organisations that
      have an annual turnover of over £36 million and operations in the UK, to publish
      a slavery and human trafficking statement each financial year, setting out steps
      to ensure no such cases occur in their supply chains and direct business operations.   
         </li>\r\n<li>Section 1502 of the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/opa/Article/2012-2012-163htm---related-materials.html\">Dodd-Frank
      Act</a>, which in 2010 introduced a legal requirement for companies that file
      with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to report on their due
      diligence to ensure that their sourcing of certain minerals does not fund armed
      groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h1>Program
      Scaling</h1>\r\n<p>As an increasing number of laws seeking to enhance the accountability
      of business in the human rights area come into existence, the projects in this
      program will continue to assess their impact on corporate disclosures and their
      effectiveness in raising the bar for industry standards.</p>\r\n<p>In 2019,
      making use of platform features, we piloted the development of bespoke analysis
      metrics for the legislative frameworks program.</p>\r\n<p>By bringing the analysis
      of the Modern Slavery Act data onto the WikiRate.org platform, it is now easier
      and faster for our partners to use the data in publications and advocacy, simply
      because the analysis is dynamically updated when new data is added to the platform
      through the ongoing research engagements.</p>\r\n<p>Expansion opportunities
      for this program are diverse. Whether it is about deepening or broadening projects
      and engagements, we are always keen to hear from our community and find out
      what is of most interest to you.</p>\r\n<p>Would you like to learn more or get

      by the WikiRate team is varied. Depending on project and partner needs, we assist
      with:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Extracting big datasets from public sources through
      scraping</li>\r\n<li>Setting up data structures on the WikiRate platform that
      can capture (new) datasets in an open format so that they can be connect to
      other relating datasets</li>\r\n<li>Bringing existing datasets on to the WikiRate

      that is part of this program is four-fold: 1) mapping business relations, 2)
      gathering performance disclosures of mapped entities, 3) soliciting new disclosures
      to fill the gaps of these mappings, 4) network performance analyses. While most
      ongoing projects focus on mapping relations and performance, a few more recent
      projects are beginning to drive new disclosures and are exploring the analysis
      possibilities that draw from multiple datasets hosted on the WikiRate platform,
      which were previously disparate but are now connected.</p>\r\n<p>To provide

    :overview: Since 2016, WikiRate has been mapping relationships and performance
      of companies across their corporate networks, from factories in supply chains
      to ownership structures and investors. By connecting these entities we are aiming
      to make corporate networks transparent, understandable, and responsive – so
      that companies and their stakeholders can see, react to, and ultimately transform
      corporate network impacts. To achieve this we work with international partners
      on a number of projects that begin to tie disparate datasets together.

    :description: "<h1>Our Role</h1>\r\n<p>WikiRate has developed collective research
      projects with universities to create more information in the public domain on
      how companies impact achievement of the SDGs. Professors around the world are
      embedding WikiRate into classroom projects to facilitate experiential learning
      in real-world, practical research, inputting and analyzing organizational data.
      To date more than 3,000 students and 14 universities have taken part in this
      program and collected nearly 50,000 data points. </p>\r\n<h1>Program Scope</h1>\r\n<p>We
      support academic institutions to research company performance on the SDGs. Because
      of the wide span of the SDGs, we set-up crowd-research projects that collect
      data on diverse topics from greenhouse gas emissions to gender equality to working
      conditions.  </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We have more than 70 metrics on WikiRate that
      are linked to indicators mapped to the SDGs. These include standards providers
      such as <a href=\"https://www.globalreporting.org/Pages/default.aspx\">Global
      Reporting Initiative</a> and <a href=\"https://www.unglobalcompact.org/library/3131\">Poverty
      Footprint</a></li>\r\n<li>Research groups are able to choose what kind of data
      they want to collect. Our project structure allows them to focus in on specific
      SDG topics, industries and/or geographic areas</li>\r\n<li>Participating universities
      embed these projects into their curriculum to give students a chance to learn
      about SDG reporting practices and open data whilst taking part in a global data
      collection drive</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h1>Program Scaling</h1>\r\n<p>The scope of
      the SDGs, as well as the high number of companies that now report on ESG issues,
      means that this program is highly scalable. We have already collected nearly
      50,000 data points on more than 750 companies from across the world and anticipate
      doubling this number over the next two years. </p>\r\n<p>In addition to raw
      data collection, students are beginning to utilize analysis tools developed
      by WikiRate to assess data using Calculated Metrics. These metrics are able
      to combine the granular data to make more meaningful conclusions. Calculations
      are also dynamic and update in real-time as more research is added to the platform,
      scaling the usability of the raw data. Through calculated metrics we can, for
      instance, find out the overall disclosure level of a company or calculate a
      company's gender pay gap. </p>\r\n<p>This research has potential to connect
      citizen-generated insights to policy-makers in a useful format and according
      to relevant country priorities. Going forward, the ambition is to attract resources
      to scale in size, reach and learning outcomes, empowering individuals to contribute
      to a large-scale, actionable research.</p>\r\n<p>Would you like to take part

    :overview: With the adoption of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in
      2015 and inclusion of the private sector for the first time as a key contributor
      to the goals, it is important to track corporate contributions towards the 2030
      target.  Most corporate sustainability data is currently behind paywalls or
      difficult to access. This program focuses on looking in depth into company sustainability
      and annual reports to extract data in a structured, comparable format, so that
      communities and institutions can better understand corporate impacts and feed
      into improvements.
