    :description: "<div>Supplier networks touch virtually every corner of the globe.
      While everyone is familiar with some of these companies, the network itself
      is largely invisible. Purchasing a device in Madrid can indirectly perpetuate
      debt slavery in Multan. Unless the supplier network connecting the two is made
      visible, the purchaser has no way to react to the supply chain’s problems. So
      long as public data on corporate supplier networks remain poor and scarce, stakeholders
      are powerless to remedy the networks’ faults.</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div><a
      href=\"https://chainreact.org/\">ChainReact</a> is an effort to make supplier
      networks transparent, understandable, and responsive, so that companies and
      their stakeholders can see, react to, and ultimately transform corporate network
      impacts. The main objectives of the project are: </div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Identify
      irresponsible corporate activity</li>\r\n<li>Connect issues at corporate networks’
      edges to network drivers</li>\r\n<li>Incentivize companies to address the issues</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>As
      a key partner in ChainReact, WikiRate serves as a research partner, and the
      WikiRate.org platform as a central database for mapping corporate relationships
      and making connections between important impacts of corporate practices along
      the chain. </div>\r\n<h3>Corporate Ownership Mapping</h3>\r\n<div>The first
      major mapping effort was the integration between the WikiRate and OpenCorporates
      platforms, using the OpenCorporates API. Through this integration, basic registration
      data from companies is now captured on the WikiRate platform. Mapping these
      legal entities (OpenCorporates companies) to reporting entities (WikiRate companies)
      in turn made it possible to tie reporting entities to their legal subsidiaries
      and parent companies, thus beginning to map corporate ownership networks.</div>\r\n<h3>Supply
      Chain Mapping</h3>\r\n<div>Following the Transparency Pledge Coalition’s campaigning
      efforts in 2016, WikiRate and CERTH began extracting relationship data from
      the supplier disclosures published by apparel companies. </div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div><span
      style=\"font-size: 15.2px;\">In order to collect relationship data, CERTH developed
      an open source </span><a href=\"https://chainreact.org/Tools\" style=\"background-color:
      #ffffff; font-size: 15.2px;\">PDF table extractor tool</a><span style=\"font-size:
      15.2px;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size: 15.2px;\">that made it possible to
      scrape the contents of pdf tables</span><span style=\"font-size: 15.2px;\">.
      WikiRate further developed its </span><a href=\"https://wikirate.org/Importing%20Answers\"
      style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 15.2px;\">import tool</a><span
      style=\"font-size: 15.2px;\"> and <a href=\"https://wikirate.org/RESTful%20API\">API</a>
      to allow automated and semi-automated integrations with data from OpenCorporates,
      and imports and updates of datasets from additional sources. </span></div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>Once
      the tool had been refined, CERTH then went on to scrape the lists of smelters
      and refiners published by companies in their SEC filings, in compliance with
      section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act. <span style=\"font-size: 15.2px;\">Additional
      sources are being reviewed for usefulness, such as export-import records as
      a proxy for supplier relations. </span></div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div><span
      style=\"font-size: 15.2px;\">To date more than 13,000 relationships between
      suppliers and companies sourcing from them, have been mapped and made accessible
      through WikiRate.org and the </span><a href=\"https://ccc.wikirate.org/\" style=\"background-color:
      #ffffff; font-size: 15.2px;\">CCC factory-brand search tool</a><span style=\"font-size:
      15.2px;\">.</span></div>\r\n<h3>Investor Mapping</h3>\r\n<div>This project has
      also included investor relations, mapping investees to their investors <a href=\"https://medium.com/@WikiRate/investor-transparency-in-the-fashion-industry-an-open-data-sprint-97fafc0e1f2d\">primarily
      as a pilot effort</a> thus far. Data seems to be more dispersed than other relationship
      data, and sometimes proprietary. We are currently considering different extraction
      techniques.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h3 style=\"font-family: Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue',

      partner, <a href=\"http://thewhistle.org/\">The Whistle</a>, is an established
      human rights whistle-blowing tool, adaptable to varied contexts and needs of

      to address sectoral disclosure patterns.</p>\r\n<h3>Outcomes</h3>\r\n<p>Universities
      from around the world participated in the initial metric testing and are conducting
      the research on an ongoing basis.</p>\r\n<p>Over the past four years, the project
      has engaged <strong>1000+ students</strong>, collectively assessing over <strong>1,200
      company statements</strong>, and adding a total of <strong>25,000+ data points</strong>
      to our open data platform about companies’ performance.</p>\r\n<p>In 2018, the
      data and analysis were used by Minderoo’s Walk Free Initiative to advise governments
      around the world to adopt and improve anti-modern slavery legislations. The

      use public documents to gather data on corporate sustainability performance
      according to a topic or SDG, for example SDG 3: Good Health &amp; Well Being,
      aggregate the data on the WikiRate platform, and then use the data to address
      a specific research question. Some students use the data-gathering process to
      critique the different approaches of reporting and disclosure, and to consider
      what kinds of information is missing or difficult to compare.</p>\r\n<p>Others
      use the data to analyze disclosure rates or performance of a company over time.</p>\r\n<p>All
      the students learn more about how data is obscured, nuanced and difficult to
      compare, and think about the challenges of gathering data to understand how
      companies impact the SDG objectives.</p>\r\n<h3>Outcomes</h3>\r\n<p>A full report
      on the 2017 pilot phase included analysis of the data collected with respect
      to corporate disclosure rates across sustainability topics and specific SDGs;
      and research on the curriculum integration from a pedagogical perspective, alongside
      assessment of learning outcomes and student and professor experiences. The pilot
      outcomes were presented to member states during the 2017 UN SDG Forum at the
      High-Level Political Forum in New York, to showcase this effort to track company
      progress to the SDGs.</p>\r\n<p>In July 2011, the Indian Ministry of Corporate
      Affairs came out with the ‘National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, Environmental
      and Economic Responsibilities of Business’ (NVGs), in recognition of the role
      of businesses in improving the quality of life and the significance and long-lasting
      impacts they have on people and the planet.</p>\r\n<p>In support of this, in
      2019 Oxfam India and WikiRate piloted a project to understand and rank the environmental
      and climate disclosures of Indian companies, comparing performance disclosure
      to policy data recorded according to the NVG reporting. A group of student researchers
      from <strong>TERI School of Advanced Studies</strong> in Delhi collected data
      for the assessment.</p>\r\n<p>Oxfam India, the TERI professor and student representatives,
      alongside WikiRate presented initial results and findings to a roundtable of
      experts from civil society organizations in India working on improving corporate
      environmental impacts. Participants provided helpful feedback about how to advance
      and carry the project forward. The next iteration of this project is in development,

      Calculated metrics on WikiRate, context-based metrics will help showcase companies’
      climate footprints. </p>\r\n<h3>Capturing risk</h3>\r\n<p>For investors, climate
      change poses significant challenges and opportunities. The Task Force on Climate-related
      Financial Disclosures (TCFD) has been created to develop guidelines for what
      constitutes effective financial disclosures across industries, and to help companies
      understand what investors want from disclosure in order to measure and respond
      to climate change risks, and align disclosures.</p>\r\n<p>As the process to
      identify metrics and align disclosures develops, WikiRate is able bring relevant
      reporting standards onto the platform to research trends and gaps in corporate
      TCFD reporting, and support dynamic analyses of the data.  </p>\r\n<h3 style=\"font-family:

      style=\"font-size: 15.2px;\">WikiRate is developing dynamic visual tools that
      can capture the outputs of analysis, pulling directly from the platform API.
      This means that the visual tools (graphs, company comparisons) can be embedded
      on other websites and used by journalists, NGOs, investors, etc. and will automatically
      update with new data added to WikiRate.org.</p>\r\n<h3>On the lookout</h3>\r\n<p>If
      you know or work for an organization interested in evidence-based advocacy,
      or in helping to define key metrics and research projects around corporate climate
      impact, get in touch at info@wikirate.org or through our [[Contact Us| Contact
